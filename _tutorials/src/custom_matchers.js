/**
 Often a project will want to encapsulate custom matching code for use across
 multiple specs. Here is how to create a Jasmine-compatible custom matcher.

 A custom matcher at its root is a comparison function that takes an `actual`
 value and `expected` value. This factory is passed to Jasmine, ideally in a
 call to `beforeEach` and will be in scope and available for all of the specs
 inside a given call to `describe`. Custom matchers are torn down between specs.
 The name of the factory will be the name of the matcher exposed on the return
 value of the call to `expect`.

     determining whether two objects are equal (see:
     [`MatchersUtil`](/api/edge/MatchersUtil.html) for reference documentation).
     By using `MatchersUtil` where appropriate, custom matchers can work with
     [custom equality testers](http://localhost:4000/tutorials/custom_equality)
